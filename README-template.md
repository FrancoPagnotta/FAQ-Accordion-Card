## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 semantic markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexible box
- Mobile workflow first

### What I learned

I learned how to efficiently use absolute and relative positioning properties when working with images and also the concepts of inheritance in HTML.

In JavaScript, I learned to work with events by dealing with multiple HTML elements.

### Continuous development

My goal is to perfect myself to the maximum in the handling of HTML, CSS and JS, working in this type of real projects and soon learn React.js.

### Helpful Resources
